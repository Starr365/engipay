func reject_payment(request_id: u256)
func cancel_payment(request_id: u256)
func claim_expired(request_id: u256)
```

## 2. Reward Distribution Contract

**Purpose**: Automated distribution of platform rewards and incentives

### Features:
- Stake platform tokens for rewards
- Claim accumulated rewards
- Admin can add reward pools
- Emergency pause functionality

### Functions:
```cairo
func stake(amount: u256)
func unstake(amount: u256)
func claim_rewards()
func add_reward_pool(token: ContractAddress, reward_rate: u256)
func emergency_pause()
```

## 3. EngiPay Governance Token

**Purpose**: Platform governance and user incentives

### Features:
- ERC20-compatible token
- Staking for governance power
- Voting on platform decisions

### Functions:
```cairo
func transfer(recipient: ContractAddress, amount: u256)
func approve(spender: ContractAddress, amount: u256)
func stake_for_governance(amount: u256)
func vote(proposal_id: u256, option: u8)
func claim_staking_rewards()
```

## 4. Merchant Payment Contract

**Purpose**: Secure merchant payments with dispute resolution

### Features:
- Verified merchant registration
- Payment holds with time locks
- Dispute resolution mechanism
- Buyer protection

### Functions:

func make_payment(merchant_id: u256, amount: u256, service_description: felt)
func confirm_delivery(payment_id: u256)
func initiate_dispute(payment_id: u256, reason: felt)
func resolve_dispute(payment_id: u256, resolution: u8) // 0=buyer, 1=merchant, 2=split
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Development Stack:
- **Language**: Cairo
- **Framework**: StarkNet
- **Testing**: StarkNet Foundry
- **Deployment**: StarkNet mainnet/testnet

### Security Requirements:
- **Audit**: Professional security audit before mainnet
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
- **Emergency Functions**: Pause mechanisms
- **Upgradeability**: Proxy patterns for updates

### Integration Points:
- **Backend**: Contract interaction via RPC calls
- **Frontend**: Direct contract calls via wallets
- **Oracles**: Price feeds for USD conversions
- **Events**: Indexed for transaction tracking

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits of Custom Contracts:
- Full control over business logic
- Custom fee structures
- Enhanced user experience
- Competitive advantages

### Costs:
- Development time and complexity
- Security audit costs ($10k-50k)
- Gas costs for deployment and usage
- Maintenance and upgrade complexity

## Recommendation

**Start with existing integrations and add custom contracts only when:**
1. User demand requires specific functionality
2. Existing solutions create bottlenecks
3. Competitive advantages are identified
4. Revenue model supports development costs

**Priority order if implementing:**
1. Payment Escrow Contract (user experience improvement)
2. Reward Distribution Contract (user incentives)
3. Governance Token (long-term engagement)
4. Merchant Payment Contract (enterprise features)
