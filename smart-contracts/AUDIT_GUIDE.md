# Smart Contract Audit Guide for EngiPay

## Overview

This guide provides auditors with comprehensive information about EngiPay's smart contracts, including architecture, functionality, security considerations, and testing procedures. It ensures auditors have all necessary context for thorough security assessment.

## Contract Architecture

### Contracts Overview

EngiPay implements three core smart contracts on StarkNet:

1. **Payment Escrow Contract** (`Escrow.cairo`) - Secure payment requests
2. **EngiPay Governance Token** (`EngiToken.cairo`) - ERC20 token with governance
3. **Reward Distribution Contract** (`RewardDistributor.cairo`) - Automated reward distribution

### Architecture Principles

- **Modular Design**: Each contract has a single, clear responsibility
- **Emergency Controls**: All contracts include pause mechanisms
- **Event-Driven**: Comprehensive event logging for transparency
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with owner controls
- **Upgradeability**: Designed with future upgradeability in mind

## 1. Payment Escrow Contract Audit

### Contract Purpose
Secure on-chain escrow for payment requests, eliminating counterparty risk in peer-to-peer payments.

### Key Functions

#### Core Functionality
```cairo
func create_payment_request(recipient, amount, token, expiry_hours, memo)
func accept_payment(request_id)
func reject_payment(request_id)
func cancel_payment(request_id)
func claim_expired(request_id)
```

#### Administrative Functions
```cairo
func update_platform_fee(new_fee)
func update_fee_recipient(new_recipient)
func emergency_pause()
```

### Security Considerations

#### Access Control
- ✅ Owner-only functions properly protected
- ✅ User functions validate caller permissions
- ✅ Emergency functions restricted to owner

#### Input Validation
- ✅ Amount validation (> 0)
- ✅ Address validation (non-zero, not self)
- ✅ Time validation (reasonable expiry periods)

#### State Management
- ✅ Request status properly tracked
- ✅ Expiration logic implemented
- ✅ Double-spend prevention

### Audit Focus Areas

#### Critical Vulnerabilities to Check
```cairo
🔍 Reentrancy attacks
🔍 Integer overflow/underflow
🔍 Access control bypass
🔍 Timestamp manipulation
🔍 Denial of service attacks
🔍 Front-running vulnerabilities
```

#### Business Logic Validation
```cairo
✅ Payment request creation
✅ Acceptance workflow
✅ Rejection workflow
✅ Cancellation workflow
✅ Expiration handling
✅ Fee calculation accuracy
```

#### Edge Cases
```cairo
✅ Zero amount requests
✅ Self-payment attempts
✅ Expired request claims
✅ Multiple accept attempts
✅ Emergency pause functionality
```

### Test Scenarios for Auditors

#### Happy Path Tests
1. Create payment request → Accept → Complete
2. Create payment request → Reject → Refund
3. Create payment request → Cancel → Refund
4. Create payment request → Expire → Claim

#### Error Path Tests
1. Accept non-existent request
2. Accept already processed request
3. Cancel by non-sender
4. Claim non-expired request

#### Security Tests
